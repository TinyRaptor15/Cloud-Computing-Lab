        <h1>About T.S.</h1>
        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>I like to <em>explore</em> the mountains by going on <strong>hikes</strong> and <strong>drives</strong>. <em>Urban exploration</em> is fun too!
            I am a big fan of <em>watersports</em> and love <strong>boating</strong> and <strong>swimming</strong>. 
            I also enjoy playing <em>video games</em> in my free time.
        </p>
        <h2>Family</h2>
        <p>I am the oldest in my family! 
            I have 3 siblings, and my family lives here in the United States. 
            We love to mess around with each other.
        </p>
        <h2>Aspirations</h2>
        <p>I am trying to get as involved as possible in cybersecurity, so I have been trying to attend as many related club events as possible.
            I have been trying to get better at CTFs and now am trying to get ready for NCAE tryouts in a couple of weeks. 
            I am doing all of this so that I can develop greater cyber skills and to explore around more, since I learn from doing and experiencing!
            It's been a great way to see the theory that we learn in classes being applied outside the classroom in relevant ways.
